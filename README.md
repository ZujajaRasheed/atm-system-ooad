 🏦 ATM Management System (OOAD Project)

This is a complete ATM Management System project designed using **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** methodology. The project focuses on modeling real-world ATM functionalities using **UML diagrams** without implementing actual code.

 📌 Project Overview

The ATM Management System allows users to perform core banking operations such as logging in, checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing money. This project models these operations using OOAD practices to understand system behavior and structure.



## 📚 UML Diagrams Included

The following diagrams are part of the project:

- ✅ **Use Case Diagram** – Shows user interactions with the system  
- ✅ **Class Diagram** – Models classes, attributes, operations, and relationships  
- ✅ **Sequence Diagram** – Represents interaction sequences between objects  
- ✅ **Activity Diagram** – Describes workflow and actions  
- ✅ **State Diagram** – Models the state changes of ATM system  
- ✅ **Component Diagram** – Describes the software components and dependencies  

 🧠 Key Concepts

This project demonstrates:

- Object-Oriented Thinking – Modeling based on real-world entities  
- System Decomposition – Dividing a complex system into manageable classes and components  
- UML Mastery – Applying multiple UML diagram types for full system coverage  
- Design without Code – Planning system architecture before implementation
